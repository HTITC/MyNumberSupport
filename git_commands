* Very good practical reference:
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/315911/git-for-beginners-the-definitive-practical-guide

* Stage all new files
    git add .
    (v1.x - ignores deleted files; v2.x stages deleted files too.)
    See: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/572549/difference-between-git-add-a-and-git-add

* Stage all modified files
    git add -u

* Stage all changes including added files:
    git add -A
    (equal to 'git add .' followed by 'git add -u')

* Commit staged changes
    git commit  -m 'description'
    git commit -am 'description'
    // -a automatically stage modified and deleted files (but not added files)

* Push to remote repository
        git push
    OR
        git push origin master
